          OverVue is a prototyping tool that allows developers to dynamically
          create and visualize a Vue application, implementing a real-time
          intuitive tree display of component hierarchy and a live-generated
          code preview. The resulting boilerplate can be exported as a template
          for further development. The best way to get started is by following
          our new user tutorial.{" "}

            color and sizing

            Export custom boilerplate code for Vue 3.0 applications including
            all the neccessary npm packages, Oauth login of your choice,
            customized Vue SFC&apos;s, and component testing files

        <h3>New to Vue 8.0</h3>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Vue 8.0 augments prototyping abilities with the addition of element+
          components, snap to grid positioning, and exportable color and sizing.
          In addition, users can now add Oauth boilerplate code for github and
          google to their exportable code, as well as Vue component testing for
          elements created in-app.{" "}
